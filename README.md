## 📝 Project Description

This project is part of my 6-week internship at **Codetech IT Solutions** under the mentorship of **Mr. Neela Santosh**. The aim was to design and build a fully functional **multi-page E-Learning Platform UI** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The platform allows users to:
- Explore available web development courses  
- Track their progress through lessons  
- View embedded video content (YouTube-based)  
- Navigate smoothly across all pages with a clean, responsive interface  

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Design a modern, interactive e-learning frontend
- Provide a homepage (`index.html`) to introduce the platform
- Enable course listing through `courses.html`
- Let users track lesson completion in `course.html`
- Show video-based lessons via `video.html`
- Support progress tracking using checkboxes and a dynamic progress bar
- Use YouTube embeds for lesson content

---

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Page structure
- **CSS3** – Styling, layout, responsive design
- **JavaScript** – Interactivity, progress tracking, dynamic video loading

---

## 🛠️ Development Process

1. **Homepage (index.html)**  
   A visually appealing landing page that introduces the platform and links to other pages.

2. **Courses Page (courses.html)**  
   Displays a list of lessons with clickable links that route to `video.html` with lesson data in query params.

3. **Progress Tracker (course.html)**  
   Uses checkboxes for lessons and dynamically updates a progress bar with JavaScript.

4. **Lesson Viewer (video.html)**  
   Parses lesson ID from URL and loads corresponding YouTube video, title, and description.

5. **Script Handling (script.js)**  
   Handles:
   - Dynamic loading of video content
   - Progress calculation
   - Navigation and interaction

6. **Styling (style.css)**  
   Flexbox + CSS Grid used for layout. Color themes and animations used for a polished UI.

## 🔁 Version Control

All code changes were tracked using **Git**, and pushed to **GitHub** regularly. Git was used for:
- File renaming (e.g., `home.html` → `index.html`)
- Branching and merging
- Clean commit history

---

## ✅ Outcome

Through this project, I gained real-world experience in:
- Multi-page frontend UI development
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Embedding external media (YouTube)
- Responsive design and layout strategies
- Using Git & GitHub effectively
